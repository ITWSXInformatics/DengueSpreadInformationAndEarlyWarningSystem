# Dengue Spread Information System (DSID)

## Data 

The data files are stored in the data folder. As this work deals with two cities, Iquitos in Peru and San Juan in Puero Rico, the data has been arranged into the respecive folders. Each directory includes:
- **dengue_data.csv:** contains the total number of dengue cases
- **population_data.csv:** contains the estimated population of the city for the year
- **environment_data.csv:** contains environmental information including precipitation and temperature
- **combined_data.csv:** combines all the data sources above using some preprocessing and creates a common CSV file.
